## Usage

At the end of each of your blog posts, include the following code using the HTML editor:

    <script src="https://raw.github.com/moski/gist-Blogger/master/public/gistLoader.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

Now to include any gist template just add the following anywhere in your blog post.

	<div class="gistLoad" data-id="GistID" id="gist-GistID">Loading ....</div>

Replace "GistID" with your gist id.
